## Overview
Welcome to Microsoft Azure StorSimple device deployment. These deployment tutorials apply to StorSimple 8000 Series Update 1.0. This series of tutorials describes how to configure your StorSimple device, and includes a configuration checklist, configuration prerequisites, and detailed configuration steps.

The information in these tutorials assumes that you have reviewed the safety precautions, and unpacked, racked, and cabled your StorSimple device. If you still need to perform those tasks, start with reviewing the [safety precautions](storsimple-safety.md). Depending on your device model, you can then unpack, rack mount, and cable by following the instructions in:

* [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8100](storsimple-8100-hardware-installation.md)
* [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8600](storsimple-8600-hardware-installation.md)

You will need administrator privileges to complete the setup and configuration process. We recommend that you review the configuration checklist before you begin. The deployment and configuration process can take some time to complete.

## Deployment prerequisites
The following sections explain the configuration prerequisites for your StorSimple Manager service and your StorSimple device.

### For the StorSimple Manager service
Before you begin, make sure that:

* You have your Microsoft account with access credentials.

* You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.

* Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for the StorSimple Manager service. Your subscription should be purchased through the [Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/).

* You have access to terminal emulation software such as PuTTY.


### For the device in the datacenter
Before configuring the device, make sure that:

* Your device is fully unpacked, mounted on a rack and fully cabled for power, network, and serial access as described in:

  * [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8100 device](storsimple-8100-hardware-installation.md)
* [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8600 device](storsimple-8600-hardware-installation.md)


### For the network in the datacenter
Before you begin, make sure that:

* The ports in your datacenter firewall are opened to allow for iSCSI and cloud traffic as described in [Networking requirements for your StorSimple device](storsimple-system-requirements.md#networking-requirements-for-your-storsimple-device).

## Step-by-step deployment
Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy your StorSimple device in the datacenter.

## Step 1: Create a new service
A StorSimple Manager service can manage multiple StorSimple devices. Perform the following steps to create a new instance of the StorSimple Manager service.

<!--author=alkohli last changed:01/14/2016-->


#### To create a new service

1. Using your Microsoft account credentials, log on to the Azure classic portal at this URL: [https://manage.windowsazure.com/](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

2. In the Azure classic portal , click **New** > **Data Services** > **StorSimple Manager** > **Quick Create**.

3. In the form that is displayed, do the following:
  1. Supply a unique **Name** for your service. This is a friendly name that can be used to identify the service. The name can have between 2 and 50 characters that can be letters, numbers, and hyphens. The name must start and end with a letter or a number.
  2. Supply a **Location** for your service. In general, choose a Location closest to the geographical region where you want to deploy your device. You may also want to factor in the following: 
	 
		- If you have existing workloads in Azure that you also intend to deploy with your StorSimple device, you should use that datacenter.
		- Your StorSimple Manager service and Azure storage can be in two separate locations. In such a case, you are required to create the StorSimple Manager and Azure storage account separately. To create an Azure storage account, go to the Azure Storage service in the Azure classic portal and follow the steps in [Create an Azure Storage account](storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account). After you create this account, add it to the StorSimple Manager service by following the steps in [Configure a new storage account for the service](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough.md#configure-a-new-storage-account-for-the-service).
		 
  3. Choose a **Subscription** from the drop-down list. The subscription is linked to your billing account. This field is not present if you have only one subscription.
  4. Select **Create a new storage account** to automatically create a storage account with the service. This storage account will have a special name such as "storsimplebwv8c6dcnf." If you need your data in a different location, uncheck this box. 
  5. Click **Create StorSimple Manager** to create the service.

   ![Create StorSimple Manager](./media/storsimple-create-new-service/HCS_CreateAService-include.png)

  You will be directed to the **Service** landing page. The service creation will take a few minutes. After the service is successfully created, you will be notified appropriately and the status of the service will change to **Active**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you did not enable the automatic creation of a storage account with your service, you will need to create at least one storage account after you have successfully created a service. This storage account will be used when you create a volume container. 
> 
> * If you did not create a storage account automatically, go to [Configure a new storage account for the service](#configure-a-new-storage-account-for-the-service.md) for detailed instructions. 
> * If you enabled the automatic creation of a storage account, go to [Step 2: Get the service registration key](#step-2-get-the-service-registration-key.md).
> 
> 
## Step 2: Get the service registration key
After the StorSimple Manager service is up and running, you will need to get the service registration key. This key is used to register and connect your StorSimple device with the service.

Perform the following steps in the Azure classic portal.

<!--author=alkohli last changed: 9/17/15-->

## Step 3: Configure and register the device through Windows PowerShell for StorSimple
Use Windows PowerShell for StorSimple to complete the initial setup of your StorSimple device as explained in the following procedure. You will need to use terminal emulation software to complete this step. For more information, see [Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console](#use-putty-to-connect-to-the-device-serial-console.md).

<!--author=alkohli last changed: 12/01/15-->


### To configure and register the device

1. Access the Windows PowerShell interface on your StorSimple device serial console. See [Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console](#use-putty-to-connect-to-the-device-serial-console) for instructions. **Be sure to follow the procedure exactly or you will not be able to access the console.**

2. In the session that opens up, press Enter one time to get a command prompt. 

3. You will be prompted to choose the language that you would like to set for your device. Specify the language, and then press Enter. 

    ![StorSimple configure and register device 1](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1/HCS_RegisterYourDevice1-U1-include.png)

4. In the serial console menu that is presented, choose option 1 to log on with full access. 

    ![StorSimple register device 2](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1/HCS_RegisterYourDevice2_U1-include.png)
  
     Complete steps 5-12 to configure the minimum required network settings for your device. **These configuration steps need to be performed on the active controller of the device.** The serial console menu indicates the controller state in the banner message. If you are not connected to the active controller, disconnect and then connect to the active controller.

5. At the command prompt, type your password. The default device password is **Password1**.

6. Type the following command: `Invoke-HcsSetupWizard`. 

7. A setup wizard will appear to help you configure the network settings for the device. Supply the the following information: 
   - IP address for the DATA 0 network interface
   - Subnet mask
   - Gateway
   - IP address for Primary DNS server
    
		Note that the system is validating network settings after each step in the process.
   
      > [AZURE.NOTE] You may have to wait for a few minutes for the subnet mask and the DNS settings to be applied. If you get a "Check the network connectivity to Data 0" error message, check the physical network connection on the DATA 0 network interface of your active controller.

8. (Optional) configure your web proxy server. Although web proxy configuration is optional, **be aware that if you use a web proxy, you can only configure it here**. For more information, go to [Configure web proxy for your device](storsimple-configure-web-proxy.md).

9. Configure a Primary NTP server for your device. NTP servers are required, as your device must synchronize time so that it can authenticate with your cloud service providers. Ensure that your network allows NTP traffic to pass from your datacenter to the Internet. If this is not possible, specify an internal NTP server. 
 
10. For security reasons, the device administrator password expires after the first session, and you will need to change it now. When prompted, provide a device administrator password. A valid device administrator password must be between 8 and 15 characters. The password must contain three of the following: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters.

	<br/>![StorSimple register device 5](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1/HCS_RegisterYourDevice5_U1-include.png)

11. The final step in the setup wizard registers your device with the StorSimple Manager service. For this, you will need the service registration key that you obtained in step 2. After you supply the registration key, you may need to wait for 2-3 minutes before the device is registered.

      > [AZURE.NOTE] You can press Ctrl + C at any time to exit the setup wizard. If you have entered all the network settings (IP address for Data 0, Subnet mask, and Gateway), your entries will be retained.

	![StorSimple register device 6](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1/HCS_RegisterYourDevice6_U1-include.png)

12. After the device is registered, a Service Data Encryption key will appear. Copy this key and save it in a safe location. **This key will be required with the service registration key to register additional devices with the StorSimple Manager service.** Refer to [StorSimple security](storsimple-security.md) for more information about this key.
	
	![StorSimple register device 7](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1/HCS_RegisterYourDevice7_U1-include.png)    

      > [AZURE.NOTE] To copy the text from the serial console window, simply select the text. You should then be able to paste it in the clipboard or any text editor. DO NOT use Ctrl + C to copy the service data encryption key. Using Ctrl + C will cause you to exit the setup wizard. As a result, the device administrator password will not be changed and the device will revert to the default password.

13. Exit the serial console.

14. Return to the Azure classic portal, and complete the following steps:
  1. Double-click your StorSimple Manager service to access the **Quick Start** page.
  2. Click **View connected devices**.
  3. On the **Devices** page, verify that the device has successfully connected to the service by looking up the status. The device status should be **Online**.
   
    	![StorSimple Devices page](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device-u1/HCS_DevicesPageM_U1-include.png) 
  
        If the device status is **Offline**, wait for a couple of minutes for the device to come online. 
      
        If the device is still offline after a few minutes, then you need to make sure that your firewall network was configured as described in the [network requirements for your StorSimple device](../articles/storsimple/storsimple-system-requirements.md). 

		If you do not have HTTP 1.1 support, check port 9354 to make sure that it is open for outbound communication. This port is used for communication between the StorSimple Manager service and your StorSimple device.
     
       

## Step 4: Complete minimum device setup
For the minimum device configuration of your StorSimple device, you are required to: 

* Set up the secondary DNS server.
* Enable iSCSI on at least one network interface.
* Assign fixed IP addresses to both the controllers.

Perform the following steps in the Azure classic portal to complete the minimum device setup.

<!--author=alkohli last changed: 9/17/15-->

#### To complete the minimum StorSimple device setup

1. Select the device and click **Quick Start**. Click **Complete device setup** to start the Configure device wizard.

2. In the Configure device wizard **Basic Settings** dialog box, do the following:
  1. Supply a **friendly name** for your device. The default device name reflects information such as the device model and serial number. You can assign a friendly name of up to 64 characters to manage your device.
  2. Set the **time zone** based on the geographic location in which the device is being deployed. Your device will use this time zone for all scheduled operations.
  3. Under **DNS Settings**, provide an address for your **Secondary DNS Server**. If you are using IPv6, the field will be populated based on the IPv6 prefix provided in the Windows PowerShell interface. 
  If the secondary DNS server is not configured, you will not be allowed to save your device configuration.
  4. Under iSCSI enabled interfaces, enable at least one network for iSCSI. At least one network interface needs to be cloud-enabled and one interface needs to be iSCSI-enabled. DATA 0 is automatically cloud-enabled.
 
      ![StorSimple minimum device setup basic settings](./media/storsimple-complete-minimum-device-setup-u1/HCS_MinDeviceSetupBasicSettings1-include.png)

3. Click the arrow icon. ![StorSimple arrow icon](./media/storsimple-complete-minimum-device-setup/HCS_ArrowIcon-include.png)

4. In the **Network Interfaces** dialog box, provide the fixed IP addresses for Controller 0 and Controller 1. **The controller fixed IP addresses need to be free IPs within the subnet accessible by the device IP address.** If the DATA 0 interface was configured for IPv4, the fixed IP addresses need to be provided in the IPv4 format. If you provided a prefix for IPv6 configuration, the fixed IP addresses will be populated automatically in these fields.


    ![StorSimple minimum device setup network interfaces](./media/storsimple-complete-minimum-device-setup-u1/HCS_MinDeviceSetupNetworkInterfaces2-include.png)

    The fixed IP addresses for the controller are used for servicing the updates to the device, and therefore the fixed IPs must be routable and able to connect to the Internet. You can check that your fixed controller IPs are routable by using the [Test-HcsmConnection][Test] cmdlet. The following example shows fixed controller IPs are routed to the Internet and can access the Microsoft Update servers. 

     ![Test-HcsmConnection showing routable IPs](./media/storsimple-complete-minimum-device-setup-u1/Test-HcsmConnectionOutputRegisteredDevice.png)

5. Click the check icon ![StorSimple check icon](./media/storsimple-complete-minimum-device-setup/HCS_CheckIcon-include.png).
  You will return to the device **Quick Start** page.

 > [AZURE.NOTE] You can modify all the other device settings at any time by accessing the **Configure** page.
