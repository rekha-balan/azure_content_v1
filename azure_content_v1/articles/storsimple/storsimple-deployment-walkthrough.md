## Overview
Welcome to Microsoft Azure StorSimple device deployment. These deployment tutorials apply to StorSimple 8000 Series Release Version, StorSimple 8000 Series Update 0.1, StorSimple 8000 Series Update 0.2, and StorSimple 8000 Series Update 0.3. This series of tutorials describes how to configure your StorSimple device, and includes a configuration checklist, configuration prerequisites, and detailed configuration steps.

The information in these tutorials assumes that you have reviewed the safety precautions, and unpacked, racked, and cabled your StorSimple device. If you still need to perform those tasks, start with reviewing the [safety precautions](storsimple-safety.md). Depending on your device model, you can then unpack, rack mount, and cable by following the instructions in:

* [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8100](storsimple-8100-hardware-installation.md)
* [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8600](storsimple-8600-hardware-installation.md)

You will need administrator privileges to complete the setup and configuration process. We recommend that you review the configuration checklist before you begin. The deployment and configuration process can take some time to complete.

## Deployment prerequisites
The following sections explain the configuration prerequisites for your StorSimple Manager service, your StorSimple device, and the network in your datacenter.

### For the StorSimple Manager service
Before you begin, make sure that:

* You have your Microsoft account with access credentials.

* You have your Microsoft Azure storage account with access credentials.

* Your Microsoft Azure subscription is enabled for the StorSimple Manager service. Your subscription should be purchased through the [Enterprise Agreement](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/enterprise-agreement/).

* You have access to terminal emulation software such as PuTTY.


### For the device in the datacenter
Before configuring the device, make sure that:

* Your device is fully unpacked, mounted on a rack and fully cabled for power, network, and serial access as described in:

  * [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8100 device](storsimple-8100-hardware-installation.md)
* [Unpack, rack mount, and cable your 8600 device](storsimple-8600-hardware-installation.md)


### For the network in the datacenter
Before you begin, make sure that:

* The ports in your datacenter firewall are opened to allow for iSCSI and cloud traffic as described in [Networking requirements for your StorSimple device](storsimple-system-requirements.md#networking-requirements-for-your-storsimple-device).
* The device in your datacenter can connect to outside network. Run the following [Windows PowerShell 4.0](http://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=40855) cmdlets (tabulated below) to validate the connectivity to the outside network. Perform this validation on a computer (in datacenter network) that has connectivity to Azure and where you will deploy your StorSimple device.  

| For this parameterâ€¦ | To check the validityâ€¦ | Run these commands/cmdlets. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IP**</br>**Subnet**</br>**Gateway** |Is this a valid IPv4 or IPv6 address?</br>Is this a valid subnet?</br>Is this a valid gateway?</br>Is this a duplicate IP on network? |`ping ip`</br>`arp -a`</br>The `ping` and `arp` commands should fail indicating that there is no device in the datacenter network that is using this IP. |
|  | | |
| **DNS** |Is this a valid DNS and can resolve Azure URLs? |`Resolve-DnsName -Name www.bing.com -Server <DNS server IP address>` </br>An alternative command that can be used is:</br>`nslookup --dns-ip=<DNS server IP address> www.bing.com` |
|  |Check if port 53 is open. This is applicable only if you are using an external DNS for your device. Internal DNS should automatically resolve the external URLs. |`Test-Port -comp dc1 -port 53 -udp -UDPtimeout 10000`  </br>[More information on this cmdlet](http://learn-powershell.net/2011/02/21/querying-udp-ports-with-powershell/) |
|  | | |
| **NTP** |We trigger a time sync as soon as NTP server is input. Check UDP port 123 is open when you input `time.windows.com` or public time servers). |[Download and use this script](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/scriptcenter/Get-Network-NTP-Time-with-07b216ca). |
|  | | |
| **Proxy (optional)** |Is this a valid proxy URI and port? </br> Is the authentication mode correct? |<code>wget http://bing.com &#124; % {$_.StatusCode}</code></br>This command should be run immediately after configuring web proxy. If a status code of 200 is returned, it indicates that the connection is successful. |
|  |Is traffic routable through proxy? |Run the DNS validation, NTP check or HTTP check once after configuring proxy on your device. This will give a clear picture if traffic is getting blocked at proxy or elsewhere. |
|  | | |
| **Registration** |Check if outbound TCP ports 443, 80, 9354 are open. |`Test-NetConnection -Port   443 -InformationLevel Detailed`</br>[More information for Test-NetConnection cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn372891.aspx) |

## Step-by-step deployment
Use the following step-by-step instructions to deploy your StorSimple device in the datacenter.

## Step 1: Create a new service
A StorSimple Manager service can manage multiple StorSimple devices. For the deployment of your first StorSimple device, you will need to create a new StorSimple Manager service.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Skip this step if you have an existing StorSimple Manager service and you intend to deploy your StorSimple device with that service.
> 
> 
Perform the following steps to create a new instance of the StorSimple Manager service.

<!--author=alkohli last changed:01/14/2016-->


#### To create a new service

1. Using your Microsoft account credentials, log on to the Azure classic portal at this URL: [https://manage.windowsazure.com/](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

2. In the Azure classic portal , click **New** > **Data Services** > **StorSimple Manager** > **Quick Create**.

3. In the form that is displayed, do the following:
  1. Supply a unique **Name** for your service. This is a friendly name that can be used to identify the service. The name can have between 2 and 50 characters that can be letters, numbers, and hyphens. The name must start and end with a letter or a number.
  2. Supply a **Location** for your service. In general, choose a Location closest to the geographical region where you want to deploy your device. You may also want to factor in the following: 
	 
		- If you have existing workloads in Azure that you also intend to deploy with your StorSimple device, you should use that datacenter.
		- Your StorSimple Manager service and Azure storage can be in two separate locations. In such a case, you are required to create the StorSimple Manager and Azure storage account separately. To create an Azure storage account, go to the Azure Storage service in the Azure classic portal and follow the steps in [Create an Azure Storage account](storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account). After you create this account, add it to the StorSimple Manager service by following the steps in [Configure a new storage account for the service](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough.md#configure-a-new-storage-account-for-the-service).
		 
  3. Choose a **Subscription** from the drop-down list. The subscription is linked to your billing account. This field is not present if you have only one subscription.
  4. Select **Create a new storage account** to automatically create a storage account with the service. This storage account will have a special name such as "storsimplebwv8c6dcnf." If you need your data in a different location, uncheck this box. 
  5. Click **Create StorSimple Manager** to create the service.

   ![Create StorSimple Manager](./media/storsimple-create-new-service/HCS_CreateAService-include.png)

  You will be directed to the **Service** landing page. The service creation will take a few minutes. After the service is successfully created, you will be notified appropriately and the status of the service will change to **Active**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you did not enable the automatic creation of a storage account with your service, you will need to create at least one storage account after you have successfully created a service. This storage account will be used when you create a volume container.
> 
> If you did not create a storage account automatically, go to [Configure a new storage account for the service](#configure-a-new-storage-account-for-the-service.md) for detailed instructions.
> If you enabled the automatic creation of a storage account, go to [Step 2: Get the service registration key](#step-2:-get-the-service-registration-key.md).
> 
> 
## Step 2: Get the service registration key
After the StorSimple Manager service is up and running, you will need to get the service registration key. This key is used to register and connect your StorSimple device with the service.

Perform the following steps in the Azure classic portal.

## Step 3: Configure and register the device through Windows PowerShell for StorSimple
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Prior to performing this configuration, unplug all the network interfaces other than DATA 0 on both (active and passive) the controllers.
> 
> 
Use Windows PowerShell for StorSimple to complete the initial setup of your StorSimple device as explained in the following procedure. You will need to use terminal emulation software to complete this step. For more information, see [Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console](#use-putty-to-connect-to-the-device-serial-console.md).

<!--author=alkohli last changed: 12/01/15-->


#### To configure and register the device

1. Access the Windows PowerShell interface on your StorSimple device serial console. See [Use PuTTY to connect to the device serial console](#use-putty-to-connect-to-the-device-serial-console) for instructions. **Be sure to follow the procedure exactly or you will not be able to access the console.**

2. In the session that opens up, press Enter one time to get a command prompt. 

3. You will be prompted to choose the language that you would like to set for your device. Specify the language, and then press Enter. 

    ![StorSimple configure and register device 1](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device/HCS_RegisterYourDevice1-include.png)

4. In the serial console menu that is presented, choose option 1 to log on with full access. 

    ![StorSimple register device 2](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device/HCS_RegisterYourDevice2-include.png)
  
     Complete steps 5-12 to configure the minimum required network settings for your device. **These configuration steps need to be performed on the active controller of the device.** The serial console menu indicates the controller state in the banner message. If you are not connected to the active controller, disconnect and then connect to the active controller.

5. At the command prompt, type your password. The default device password is **Password1**.

6. Type the following command:

     `Invoke-HcsSetupWizard` 

7. A setup wizard will appear to help you configure the network settings for the device. Supply the the following information: 
   - IP address for the DATA 0 network interface
   - Subnet mask
   - Gateway
   - IP address for Primary DNS server
   - IP address for Primary NTP server
   
      > [AZURE.NOTE] You may have to wait for a few minutes for the subnet mask and the DNS settings to be applied. If you get a "The device is not ready." error message, check the physical network connection on the DATA 0 network interface of your active controller.

8. (Optional) configure your web proxy server. Although web proxy configuration is optional, **be aware that if you use a web proxy, you can only configure it here**. For more information, go to [Configure web proxy for your device](storsimple-configure-web-proxy.md). If you run into any issues during this step, refer to troubleshooting guidance for [Errors during web proxy configuration](storsimple-troubleshoot-deployment.md#errors-during-the-optional-web-proxy-settings).
 

      > [AZURE.NOTE] You can press Ctrl + C at any time to exit the setup wizard. Any settings that you applied before you issued this command will be retained.

9. For security reasons, the device administrator password expires after the first session, and you will need to change it for subsequent sessions. When prompted, provide a device administrator password. A valid device administrator password must be between 8 and 15 characters. The password must contain a combination of lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numbers, and special characters.

10. The StorSimple Snapshot Manager password is also set here. You use this password when you authenticate a device with your Windows host running StorSimple Snapshot Manager. When prompted, provide a 14 to 15 character password. The password must contain a combination of three of the following: lowercase, uppercase, numeric, and special characters. 

    ![StorSimple register device 4](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device/HCS_RegisterYourDevice4-include.png)

    You can reset the StorSimple Snapshot Manager password from the StorSimple Manager service interface. For detailed steps, go to [Change the StorSimple passwords using the StorSimple Manager serivce](storsimple-change-passwords.md).

	To troubleshoot any issues during this step, refer to troubleshooting guidance for [Errors related to passwords](storsimple-troubleshoot-deployment.md#errors-related-to-device-administrator-and-storsimple-snapshot-manager-passwords).

11. The final step in the setup wizard registers your device with the StorSimple Manager service. For this, you will need the service registration key that you obtained in step 2. After you supply the registration key, you may need to wait for 2-3 minutes before the device is registered.

	To troubleshoot any possible device registration failures, refer to [Errors during device registration](storsimple-troubleshoot-deployment.md#errors-during-device-registration). For detailed troubleshooting, you can also refer to [Step-by-step troubleshooting example](storsimple-troubleshoot-deployment.md#step-by-step-storsimple-troubleshooting-example).

12. After the device is registered, a Service Data Encryption key will appear. Copy this key and save it in a safe location.
	
	> [AZURE.WARNING] This key will be required with the service registration key to register additional devices with the StorSimple Manager service. Refer to [StorSimple security](../articles/storsimple/storsimple-security.md) for more information about this key.

     ![StorSimple register device 6](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device/HCS_RegisterYourDevice6-include.png)

     To copy the text from the serial console window, simply select the text. You should then be able to paste it in the clipboard or any text editor. DO NOT use Ctrl + C to copy the service data encryption key. Using Ctrl + C will cause you to exit the setup wizard. As a result, the device administrator password and the StorSimple Snapshot Manager password will not be changed and the device will revert to the default passwords.

13. Exit the serial console.

14. Return to the Azure classic portal, and complete the following steps:
  1. Double-click your StorSimple Manager service to access the **Quick Start** page.
  2. Click **View connected devices**.
  3. On the **Devices** page, verify that the device has successfully connected to the service by looking up the status. The device status should be **Online**. If the device status is **Offline**, wait for a couple of minutes for the device to come online.
   
    ![StorSimple Devices page](./media/storsimple-configure-and-register-device/HCS_DevicesPageM-include.png) 
  
      > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] After the device is online, plug in the network cables that you had unplugged in the beginning of this step.

After the device is successfully registered and doesn't come online, you can run the `Test-HcsmConnection -Verbose` to ensure that the network connectivity is healthy.

#### To create a volume

1. On the device **Quick Start** page, click **Add a volume**. This starts the Add a volume wizard.

2. In the Add a volume wizard, under **Basic Settings**, do the following:
   1. Supply a **Name** for your volume.
   2. Specify the **Provisioned Capacity** for your volume in GB or TB. The volume capacity must be between 1 GB and 64 TB for a physical device.
   3. On the drop-down list, select the **Usage Type** for your volume. 
   4. If you are using this volume for archival data, select the **Use this volume for less frequently accessed archival data** check box. For all other use cases, simply select **Tiered Volume**. (Tiered volumes were formerly called primary volumes).
   4. Click the arrow icon ![arrow-icon](./media/storsimple-create-volume/HCS_ArrowIcon-include.png) to go to the next page.

        ![Add volume](./media/storsimple-create-volume/AddVolume1-include.png)

3. In the **Additional Settings** dialog box, add a new access control record (ACR):
   1. Supply a **Name** for your ACR.
   2. Under **iSCSI Initiator Name**, provide the iSCSI Qualified Name (IQN) of your Windows host. If you don't have the IQN, go to [Get the IQN of a Windows Server host](#get-the-iqn-of-a-windows-server-host).
   3. We recommend that you enable a default backup by selecting the **Enable a default backup for this volume** check box. The default backup will create a policy that executes at 22:30 each day (device time) and creates a cloud snapshot of this volume.

        > [AZURE.NOTE] After the backup is enabled here, it cannot be reverted. You will need to edit the volume to modify this setting.

        ![Add volume](./media/storsimple-create-volume/AddVolume2-include.png)

4. Click the check icon ![check icon](./media/storsimple-create-volume/HCS_CheckIcon-include.png). A volume will be created with the specified settings.

## Step 7: Mount, initialize, and format a volume
> [!IMPORTANT]
> 
> * For the high availability of your StorSimple solution, we recommend that you configure MPIO on your Windows Server host (optional) prior to configuring iSCSI on your Windows Server host. MPIO configuration on host servers will ensure that the servers can tolerate a link, network, or interface failure.
> 
> * For MPIO and iSCSI installation and configuration instructions, go to [Configure MPIO for your StorSimple device](storsimple-configure-mpio-windows-server.md). These will also include the steps to mount, initialize and format StorSimple volumes.
> 
> 
> 
If you decide not to configure MPIO, perform the following steps to mount, initialize, and format your StorSimple volumes.

<!--author=SharS last changed: 9/17/15-->

#### To mount, initialize, and format a volume

1. Start the Microsoft iSCSI initiator.
