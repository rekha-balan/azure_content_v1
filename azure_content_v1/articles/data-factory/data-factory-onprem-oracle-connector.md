# Move data from on-premises Oracle using Azure Data Factory
This article outlines how you can use data factory copy activity to move data from Oracle to another data store. This article builds on the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article which presents a general overview of data movement with copy activity and supported data store combinations.

## Installation
For the Azure Data Factory service to be able to connect to your on-premises Oracle database , you must install the following: 

* Data Management Gateway on the same machine that hosts the database or on a separate machine to avoid competing for resources with the database. Data Management Gateway is a software that connects on-premises data sources to cloud services in a secure and managed way. See [Move data between on-premises and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article for details about Data Management Gateway. 
* [Oracle Data Access Components (ODAC) for Windows](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/downloads/index.html). It must be installed on the host machine where the gateway is installed.

> [!NOTE]
> See [Gateway Troubleshooting](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md#gateway-troubleshooting) for tips on troubleshooting connection/gateway related issues.

## Sample: Copy data from Oracle to Azure Blob
This sample shows how to copy data from an on-premises Oracle database to an Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  

The sample has the following data factory entities:

1. A linked service of type [OnPremisesOracle](data-factory-onprem-oracle-connector.md#oracle-linked-service-properties).
2. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties).
3. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [OracleTable](data-factory-onprem-oracle-connector.md#oracle-dataset-type-properties). 
4. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
5. A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy activity that uses [OracleSource](data-factory-onprem-oracle-connector.md#oracle-copy-activity-type-properties) as source and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties) as sink.

The sample copies data from a table in an on-premises Oracle database to a blob every hour. For more information on various properties used in the sample below please refer to documentation on different properties in the sections following the samples.

**Oracle linked service:**

    {
      "name": "OnPremisesOracleLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "OnPremisesOracle",
        "typeProperties": {
          "ConnectionString": "data source=<data source>;User Id=<User Id>;Password=<Password>;",
          "gatewayName": "<gateway name>"
        }
      }
    }

**Azure Blob storage linked service:**

    {
      "name": "StorageLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
          "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<account name>;AccountKey=<Account key>"
        }
      }
    }

**Oracle input dataset:**

The sample assumes you have created a table “MyTable” in Oracle and it contains a column called “timestampcolumn” for time series data. 

Setting “external”: ”true” and specifying externalData policy tells data factory that this is a table that is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

    {
        "name": "OracleInput",
        "properties": {
            "type": "OracleTable",
            "linkedServiceName": "OnPremisesOracleLinkedService",
            "typeProperties": {
                "tableName": "MyTable"
            },
               "external": true,
            "availability": {
                "offset": "01:00:00",
                "interval": "1",
                "anchorDateTime": "2014-02-27T12:00:00",
                "frequency": "Hour"
            },
          "policy": {     
               "externalData": {        
                    "retryInterval": "00:01:00",    
                    "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",       
                    "maximumRetry": 3       
                }     
              }
        }
    }


**Azure Blob output dataset:**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path and file name for the blob are dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

    {
      "name": "AzureBlobOutput",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureBlob",
        "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
          "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder/yearno={Year}/monthno={Month}/dayno={Day}/hourno={Hour}",
          "partitionedBy": [
            {
              "name": "Year",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "yyyy"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Month",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "%M"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Day",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "%d"
              }
            },
            {
              "name": "Hour",
              "value": {
                "type": "DateTime",
                "date": "SliceStart",
                "format": "%H"
              }
            }
          ],
          "format": {
            "type": "TextFormat",
            "columnDelimiter": "\t",
            "rowDelimiter": "\n"
          }
        },
        "availability": {
          "frequency": "Hour",
          "interval": 1
        }
      }
    }


**Pipeline with Copy activity:**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **RelationalSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**.  The SQL query specified with **oracleReaderQuery** property selects the data in the past hour to copy.

    {  
        "name":"SamplePipeline",
        "properties":{  
        "start":"2014-06-01T18:00:00",

              },
              "sink": {
                "type": "BlobSink"

              "timeout": "01:00:00"
            }
          }
         ]
       }
    }

## Oracle Linked Service properties
The following table provides description for JSON elements specific to Oracle linked service. 

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type |The type property must be set to: **OnPremisesOracle** |Yes |
| connectionString |Specify information needed to connect to the Oracle Database instance for the connectionString property. |Yes  |
| gatewayName |Name of the gateway that will be used to connect to the onpremises Oracle server |Yes |

See [Setting Credentials and Security](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md#setting-credentials-and-security) for details about setting credentials for an on-premises Oracle data source.

## Oracle Dataset type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets please refer to the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections like structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types (Oracle, Azure blob, Azure table, etc...).

The typeProperties section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location of the data in the data store. The typeProperties section for the dataset of type OracleTable has the following properties.

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tableName |Name of the table in the Oracle Database that the linked service refers to. |No (if **oracleReaderQuery** of **SqlSource** is specified) |

## Oracle Copy Activity type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities please refer to the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties like name, description, input and output tables, various policies etc are available for all types of activities. 

**Note:** The Copy Activity takes only one input and produces only one output.

Properties available in the typeProperties section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type and in case of Copy activity they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

In case of Copy activity when source is of type **OracleSource** the following properties are available in **typeProperties** section:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| oracleReaderQuery |Use the custom query to read data. |SQL query string.  |
| For example: select * from MyTable <p>If not specified, the SQL statement that is executed: select * from MyTable</p> |No (if **tableName** of **dataset** is specified) |

## Specifying structure definition for rectangular datasets
The structure section in the datasets JSON is an **optional** section for rectangular tables (with rows & columns) and contains a collection of columns for the table. You will use the structure section for either providing type information for type conversions or doing column mappings. The following sections describe these features in detail. 

Each column contains the following properties:

| Property | Description | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| name | Name of the column. | Yes |
| type | Data type of the column. See type conversions section below for more details regarding when should you specify type information | No |
| culture | .NET based culture to be used when type is specified and is .NET type Datetime or Datetimeoffset. Default is “en-us”.  | No |
| format | Format string to be used when type is specified and is .NET type Datetime or Datetimeoffset. | No |

The following sample shows the structure section JSON for a table that has three columns userid, name, and lastlogindate.

    "structure": 
    [
        { "name": "userid"},
        { "name": "name"},
        { "name": "lastlogindate"}
    ],

Please use the following guidelines for when to include “structure” information and what to include in the **structure** section.

1.	**For structured data sources** that store data schema and type information along with the data itself (sources like SQL Server, Oracle, Azure table etc.), you should specify the “structure” section only if you want do column mapping of specific source columns to specific columns in sink and their names are not the same (see details in column mapping section below). 

	As mentioned above, the type information is optional in “structure” section. For structured sources, type information is already available as part of dataset definition in the data store, so you should not include type information when you do include the “structure” section.
2. **For schema on read data sources (specifically Azure blob)**  you can chose to store data without storing any schema or type information with the data. For these types of data sources you should include “structure” in the following 2 cases:
	1. You want to do column mapping.
	2. When the dataset is a source in a Copy activity, you can provide type information in “structure” and data factory will use this type information for conversion to native types for the sink. See [Move data to and from Azure Blob](../articles/data-factory/data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md) article for more information.

### Supported .NET-based types 
Data factory supports the following CLS compliant .NET based type values for providing type information in “structure” for schema on read data sources like Azure blob.

- Int16
- Int32 
- Int64
- Single
- Double
- Decimal
- Byte[]
- Bool
- String 
- Guid
- Datetime
- Datetimeoffset
- Timespan 

For Datetime & Datetimeoffset you can also optionally specify “culture” & “format” string to facilitate parsing of your custom Datetime string. See sample for type conversion below.



### Type Mapping for Oracle
As mentioned in the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article Copy activity performs automatic type conversions from automatic type conversions from source types to sink types with the following 2 step approach:

1. Convert from native source types to .NET type
2. Convert from .NET type to native sink type

When moving data from Oracle, the following mappings will be used from Oracle data type to .NET type and vice versa.

| Oracle data type | .NET Framework data type |
| --- | --- |
| BFILE |Byte[]] |
| BLOB |Byte[]] |
| CHAR |String |
| CLOB |String |
| DATE |DateTime |
| FLOAT |Decimal |
| INTEGER |Decimal |
| INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH |Int32 |
| INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND |TimeSpan |
| LONG |String |
| LONG RAW |Byte[]] |
| NCHAR |String |
| NCLOB |String |
| NUMBER |Decimal |
| NVARCHAR2 |String |
| RAW |Byte[]] |
| ROWID |String |
| TIMESTAMP |DateTime |
| TIMESTAMP WITH LOCAL TIME ZONE |DateTime |
| TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE |DateTime |
| UNSIGNED INTEGER |Number |
| VARCHAR2 |String |
| XML |String |

## Troubleshooting tips
**Problem: **
You see the following **error message**: Copy activity met invalid parameters: 'UnknownParameterName', Detailed message: Unable to find the requested .Net Framework Data Provider. It may not be installed”.  

**Possible causes**

1. The .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle was not installed.
2. The .NET Framework Data Provider for Oracle was installed to .NET Framework 2.0 and is not found in the .NET Framework 4.0 folders. 

**Resolution/Workaround**

1. If you haven't installed the .NET Provider for Oracle, please [install it](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/dotnet/utilsoft-086879.html) and retry the scenario. 
2. If you get the error message even after installing the provider, do the following:    1. Open machine config of .NET 2.0 from the folder: <system disk>:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v2.0.50727\CONFIG\machine.config.
2. Search for **Oracle Data Provider for .NET**, and you should be able to find an entry like below under **system.data** -> **DbProviderFactories**:        “<add name="Oracle Data Provider for .NET" invariant="Oracle.DataAccess.Client" description="Oracle Data Provider for .NET" type="Oracle.DataAccess.Client.OracleClientFactory, Oracle.DataAccess, Version=2.112.3.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=89b483f429c47342" />”


3. Copy this entry to the machine.config file in the following v4.0 folder: <system disk>:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework64\v4.0.30319\Config\machine.config, and change the version to 4.xxx.x.x.
4. Install “<ODP.NET Installed Path>\11.2.0\client_1\odp.net\bin\4\Oracle.DataAccess.dll” into the global assembly cache (GAC) by running “gacutil /i [provider path]provider path]”.

## Column mapping with translator rules
Column mapping can be used to specify how columns specified in the “structure” of source table map to columns specified in the “structure” of sink table. The **columnMapping** property is available in the **typeProperties** section of the Copy activity.

Column mapping supports the following scenarios:

1.	All columns in the source table “structure” are mapped to all columns in the sink table “structure”.
2.	A subset of the columns in the source table “structure” are mapped to all columns in the sink table “structure”.

The following are error conditions and will result in an exception:

1.	Either fewer columns or more columns in the “structure” of sink table than specified in the mapping.
2.	Duplicate mapping.
3.	SQL query result does not have a column name that is specified in the mapping.

## Column mapping samples
> [AZURE.NOTE] The samples below are for Azure SQL and Azure Blob but are applicable in the same way for any data store that supports rectangular tables. You will have to adjust dataset and linked service definitions in examples below to point to data in the relevant data source.

### Sample 1 – column mapping from Azure SQL to Azure blob
In this sample, the input table has a structure and it points to a SQL table in an Azure SQL database.

	{
	    "name": "AzureSQLInput",
	    "properties": {
	        "structure": 
	         [
	           { "name": "userid"},
	           { "name": "name"},
	           { "name": "group"}
	         ],
	        "type": "AzureSqlTable",
	        "linkedServiceName": "AzureSqlLinkedService",
	        "typeProperties": {
	            "tableName": "MyTable"
	        },
	        "availability": {
	            "frequency": "Hour",
	            "interval": 1
	        },
			"external": true,
			"policy": {
	            "externalData": {
	                "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
	                "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
	                "maximumRetry": 3
	            }
			}
	    }
	}

In this sample, the output table has a structure and it points to a blob in an Azure blob storage.

	{
	    "name": "AzureBlobOutput",
	    "properties":
	    {
	         "structure": 
	          [
	                { "name": "myuserid"},
	                { "name": "myname" },
	                { "name": "mygroup"}
	          ],
	        "type": "AzureBlob",
	        "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
	        "typeProperties": {
	            "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder",
	            "fileName":"myfile.csv",
	            "format":
	            {
	                "type": "TextFormat",
	                "columnDelimiter": ","
	            }
	        },
	        "availability":
	        {
	            "frequency": "Hour",
	            "interval": 1
	        }
	    }
	}

The JSON for the activity is shown below. The columns from source mapped to columns in sink (**columnMappings**) by using **Translator** property.

	{
	    "name": "CopyActivity",
	    "description": "description", 
	    "type": "Copy",
	    "inputs":  [ { "name": "AzureSQLInput"  } ],
	    "outputs":  [ { "name": "AzureBlobOutput" } ],
	    "typeProperties":    {
	        "source":
	        {
	            "type": "SqlSource"
	        },
	        "sink":
	        {
	            "type": "BlobSink"
	        },
	        "translator": 
	        {
	            "type": "TabularTranslator",
	            "ColumnMappings": "UserId: MyUserId, Group: MyGroup, Name: MyName"
	        }
	    },
	   "scheduler": {
	          "frequency": "Hour",
	          "interval": 1
	        }
	}

**Column mapping flow:**

### Sample 2 – column mapping with SQL query from Azure SQL to Azure blob
In this sample, a SQL query is used to extract data from Azure SQL instead of simply specifying the table name and the column names in “structure” section. 

	{
	    "name": "CopyActivity",
	    "description": "description", 
	    "type": "CopyActivity",
	    "inputs":  [ { "name": " AzureSQLInput"  } ],
	    "outputs":  [ { "name": " AzureBlobOutput" } ],
	    "typeProperties":
	    {
	        "source":
	        {
	            "type": "SqlSource",
	            "SqlReaderQuery": "$$Text.Format('SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE StartDateTime = \\'{0:yyyyMMdd-HH}\\'', WindowStart)"
	        },
	        "sink":
	        {
	            "type": "BlobSink"
	        },
	        "Translator": 
	        {
	            "type": "TabularTranslator",
	            "ColumnMappings": "UserId: MyUserId, Group: MyGroup,Name: MyName"
	        }
	    },
	    "scheduler": {
	          "frequency": "Hour",
	          "interval": 1
	        }
	}
