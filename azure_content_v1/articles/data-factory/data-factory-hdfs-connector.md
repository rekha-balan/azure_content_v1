# Move data From on-premises HDFS using Azure Data Factory
This article outlines how you can use the Copy Activity in an Azure data factory to move data from an on-premises HDFS to another data store. This article builds on the [data movement activities](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md) article which presents a general overview of data movement with copy activity and supported data store combinations.

Data factory currently supports only moving data from an on-premises HDFS to other data stores, but not for moving data from other data stores to an on-premises HDFS.

## Enabling connectivity
Data Factory service supports connecting to on-premises HDFS using the Data Management Gateway. See [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article to learn about Data Management Gateway and step-by-step instructions on setting up the gateway. You need to leverage the gateway to connect to HDFS even if it is hosted in an Azure IaaS VM. 

While you can install the gateway on the same on-premises machine or the Azure VM as the HDFS, we recommend that you install the gateway on a separate machine or a separate Azure IaaS VM to avoid resource contention and for better performance. When you install the gateway on a separate machine, the machine should be able to access the machine with the HDFS. 

## Sample: Copy data from on-premises HDFS to Azure Blob
This sample shows how to copy data from an on-premises HDFS to Azure Blob Storage. However, data can be copied **directly** to any of the sinks stated [here](data-factory-data-movement-activities.md#supported-data-stores) using the Copy Activity in Azure Data Factory.  

The sample has the following data factory entities:

1. A linked service of type [OnPremisesHdfs](#hdfs-linked-service-properties.md).
2. A linked service of type [AzureStorage](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-storage-linked-service-properties).
3. An input [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [FileShare](#hdfs-dataset-type-properties.md).
4. An output [dataset](data-factory-create-datasets.md) of type [AzureBlob](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-dataset-type-properties).
5. A [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) with Copy Activity that uses [FileSystemSource](#hdfs-copy-activity-type-properties.md) and [BlobSink](data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md#azure-blob-copy-activity-type-properties).

The sample copies data from a query result in an on-premises HDFS to a blob every hour. The JSON properties used in these samples are described in sections following the samples. 

As a first step, please setup the data management gateway as per the instructions in the [moving data between on-premises locations and cloud](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) article. 

**HDFS linked service**
This example uses the Windows authentication. See [HDFS linked service](#hdfs-linked-service-properties.md) section for different types of authentication you can use. 

    {
        "name": "HDFSLinkedService",
        "properties":
        {
            "type": "Hdfs",
            "typeProperties":
            {
                "authenticationType": "Windows",
                "userName": "Administrator",
                "password": "password",
                "url" : "http://<machine>:50070/webhdfs/v1/",
                "gatewayName": "mygateway"
            }
        }
    }

**Azure Storage linked service**

    {
      "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
      "properties": {
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
          "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<accountname>;AccountKey=<accountkey>"
        }
      }
    }

**HDFS input dataset**
This dataset refers to the HDFS folder DataTransfer/UnitTest/. The pipeline copies all the files int his folder to the destination. 

Setting “external”: ”true” and specifying externalData policy (optional) informs the Data Factory service that the table is external to the data factory and not produced by an activity in the data factory.

    {
        "name": "InputDataset",
        "properties": {
            "type": "FileShare",
            "linkedServiceName": "HDFSLinkedService",

                "interval":  1
            }
        }
    }




**Azure Blob output dataset**

Data is written to a new blob every hour (frequency: hour, interval: 1). The folder path for the blob is dynamically evaluated based on the start time of the slice that is being processed. The folder path uses year, month, day, and hours parts of the start time.

    {
        "name": "OutputDataset",
        "properties": {

                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "yyyy"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Month",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "%M"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Day",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",
                            "format": "%d"
                        }
                    },
                    {
                        "name": "Hour",
                        "value": {
                            "type": "DateTime",
                            "date": "SliceStart",

                        }
                    }
                ]
            },
            "availability": {
                "frequency": "Hour",
                "interval": 1
            }
        }
    }



**Pipeline with Copy activity**

The pipeline contains a Copy Activity that is configured to use the above input and output datasets and is scheduled to run every hour. In the pipeline JSON definition, the **source** type is set to **FileSystemSource** and **sink** type is set to **BlobSink**. The SQL query specified for the **query** property selects the data in the past hour to copy.

        "name": "pipeline",
        "properties":
        {
            "activities":

                    }
                }
            ],
            "start": "2014-06-01T18:00:00Z",
            "end": "2014-06-01T19:00:00Z"
        }
    }

                "gatewayName": "mygateway"
            }
        }
    }



## HDFS Dataset type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining datasets, see the [Creating datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md) article. Sections like structure, availability, and policy of a dataset JSON are similar for all dataset types (Azure SQL, Azure blob, Azure table, etc...).

The **typeProperties** section is different for each type of dataset and provides information about the location of the data in the data store. The typeProperties section for dataset of type **FileShare** (which includes HDFS dataset) has the following properties

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| folderPath |Path to the folder. Example: myfolder<p>Use escape character ‘ \ ’ for special characters in the string. For example: for folder\subfolder, specify folder\\\\subfolder and for d:\samplefolder, specify d:\\\\samplefolder.</p><p>You can combine this with **partitionBy** to have folder paths based on slice start/end date-times.</p> |Yes |
| fileName |Specify the name of the file in the **folderPath** if you want the table to refer to a specific file in the folder. If you do not specify any value for this property, the table points to all files in the folder.<p>When fileName is not specified for an output dataset, the name of the generated file would be in the following this format: </p><p>Data.<Guid>.txt (for example: : Data.0a405f8a-93ff-4c6f-b3be-f69616f1df7a.txt</p> |No |
| partitionedBy |partitionedBy can be leveraged to specify a dynamic folderPath, filename for time series data. For example folderPath parameterized for every hour of data. |No |
| fileFilter |Specify a filter to be used to select a subset of files in the folderPath rather than all files. <p>Allowed values are: * (multiple characters) and ? (single character).</p><p>Examples 1: "fileFilter": "*.log"</p>Example 2: "fileFilter": 2014-1-?.txt"</p><p>**Note**: fileFilter is applicable for an input FileShare dataset</p> |No |
|  |compression |Specify the type and level of compression for the data. Supported types are: GZip, Deflate, and BZip2 and supported levels are: Optimal and Fastest. See [Compression support](#compression-support.md) section for more details. |No | |
|  |format |Two formats types are supported: **TextFormat**, **AvroFormat**. You need to set the type property under format to either of these values. When the format is TextFormat you can specify additional optional properties for format. See the [Specifying TextFormat](#specifying-textformat.md) section below for more details. |No |

> [!NOTE]
> filename and fileFilter cannot be used simultaneously.
> 
> 
### Leveraging partionedBy property
As mentioned above, you can specify a dynamic folderPath, filename for time series data with partitionedBy. You can do so with the Data Factory macros and the system variable SliceStart, SliceEnd that indicate the logical time period for a given data slice. 

See [Creating Datasets](data-factory-create-datasets.md), [Scheduling & Execution](data-factory-scheduling-and-execution.md), and [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) articles to understand more details on time series datasets, scheduling and slices.

#### Sample 1:
    "folderPath": "wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/{Slice}",
    "partitionedBy": 
    [
        { "name": "Slice", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyyMMddHH" } },
    ],

In the above example {Slice} is replaced with the value of Data Factory system variable SliceStart in the format (YYYYMMDDHH) specified. The SliceStart refers to start time of the slice. The folderPath is different for each slice. For example: wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/2014100103 or wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/2014100104.

#### Sample 2:
    "folderPath": "wikidatagateway/wikisampledataout/{Year}/{Month}/{Day}",
    "fileName": "{Hour}.csv",
    "partitionedBy": 
     [
        { "name": "Year", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "yyyy" } },
        { "name": "Month", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "MM" } }, 
        { "name": "Day", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "dd" } }, 
        { "name": "Hour", "value": { "type": "DateTime", "date": "SliceStart", "format": "hh" } } 
    ],

In the above example, year, month, day, and time of SliceStart are extracted into separate variables that are used by folderPath and fileName properties.

### Specifying TextFormat
If the format is set to **TextFormat**, you can specify the following **optional** properties in the **Format** section.

| Property | Description | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| columnDelimiter |The character used as a column separator in a file. Only one character is allowed at this time. This tag is optional. The default value is comma (,). |No |
| rowDelimiter |The character used as a raw separator in file. Only one character is allowed at this time. This tag is optional. The default value is any of the following: [“\r\n”, “\r”,” \n”]“\r\n”, “\r”,” \n”]. |No |
| escapeChar |<p>The special character used to escape column delimiter shown in content. This tag is optional. No default value. You must specify no more than one character for this property.</p><p>For example, if you have comma (,) as the column delimiter but you want have comma character in the text (example: “Hello, world”), you can define ‘$’ as the escape character and use string “Hello$, world” in the source.</p><p>Note that you cannot specify both escapeChar and quoteChar for a table.</p> |No |
| quoteChar |<p>The special character is used to quote the string value. The column and row delimiters inside of the quote characters would be treated as part of the string value. This tag is optional. No default value. You must specify no more than one character for this property.</p><p>For example, if you have comma (,) as the column delimiter but you want have comma character in the text (example: <Hello, world>), you can define ‘"’ as the quote character and use string <"Hello, world"> in the source. This property is applicable to both input and output tables.</p><p>Note that you cannot specify both escapeChar and quoteChar for a table.</p> |No |
| nullValue |<p>The character(s) used to represent null value in blob file content. This tag is optional. The default value is “\N”.</p><p>For example, based on above sample, “NaN” in blob will be translated as null value while copied into e.g. SQL Server.</p> |No |
| encodingName |Specify the encoding name. For the list of valid encoding names, see: [Encoding.EncodingName Property](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.text.encoding.aspx). For example: windows-1250 or shift_jis. The default value is: UTF-8. |No |

#### Samples
The following sample shows some of the format properties for TextFormat.

    "typeProperties":
    {
        "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder",
        "fileName": "myblobname"
        "format":
        {
            "type": "TextFormat",
            "columnDelimiter": ",",
            "rowDelimiter": ";",
            "quoteChar": "\"",
            "NullValue": "NaN"
        }
    },

To use an escapeChar instead of quoteChar, replace the line with quoteChar with the following:

    "escapeChar": "$",

### Specifying AvroFormat
If the format is set to AvroFormat, you do not need to specify any properties in the Format section within the typeProperties section. Example:

    "format":
    {
        "type": "AvroFormat",
    }

To use Avro format in a Hive table, you can refer to [Apache Hive’s tutorial](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AvroSerDe).

### Compression support  
Processing large data sets can cause I/O and network bottlenecks. Therefore, compressed data in stores can not only speed up data transfer across the network and save disk space, but also bring significant performance improvements in processing big data. At this time, compression is supported for file-based data stores such as Azure Blob or On-premises File System.  

To specify compression for a dataset, use the **compression** property in the dataset JSON as in the following example:   

	{  
		"name": "AzureBlobDataSet",  
	  	"properties": {  
	    	"availability": {  
	    		"frequency": "Day",  
	    	  	"interval": 1  
	    	},  
	    	"type": "AzureBlob",  
	    	"linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",  
	    	"typeProperties": {  
	    		"fileName": "pagecounts.csv.gz",  
	    	  	"folderPath": "compression/file/",  
	    	  	"compression": {  
	    	    	"type": "GZip",  
	    	    	"level": "Optimal"  
	    	  	}  
    		}  
	  	}  
	}  
 
Note that the **compression** section has two properties:  
  
- **Type:** the compression codec, which can be **GZIP**, **Deflate** or **BZIP2**.  
- **Level:** the compression ratio, which can be **Optimal** or **Fastest**. 
	- **Fastest:** The compression operation should complete as quickly as possible, even if the resulting file is not optimally compressed. 
	- **Optimal**: The compression operation should be optimally compressed, even if the operation takes a longer time to complete. 
	
	See [Compression Level](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.io.compression.compressionlevel.aspx) topic for more information. 

Suppose the above sample dataset is used as the output of a copy activity, the copy activity will compresses the output data with GZIP codec using optimal ratio and then write the compressed data into a file named pagecounts.csv.gz in the Azure Blob Storage.   

When you specify compression property in an input dataset JSON, the pipeline can read compressed data from the source and when you specify the property in an output dataset JSON, the copy activity can write compressed data to the destination. Here are a few sample scenarios: 

- Read GZIP compressed data from an Azure blob, decompress it, and write result data to an Azure SQL database. You define the input Azure Blob dataset with the compression JSON property in this case. 
- Read data from a plain-text file from on-premises File System, compress it using GZip format, and write the compressed data to an Azure blob. You define an output Azure Blob dataset with the compression JSON property in this case.  
- Read a GZIP-compressed data from an Azure blob, decompress it, compress it using BZIP2, and write result data to an Azure blob. You define the input Azure Blob dataset with compression type set to GZIP and the output dataset with compression type set to BZIP2 in this case.   


## HDFS Copy Activity type properties
For a full list of sections & properties available for defining activities, see the [Creating Pipelines](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) article. Properties like name, description, input and output tables, various policies etc. are available for all types of activities. 

Properties available in the typeProperties section of the activity on the other hand vary with each activity type and in case of Copy activity they vary depending on the types of sources and sinks.

In case of Copy Activity when source is of type **FileSystemSource** the following properties are available in typeProperties section:

**FileSystemSource** supports the following properties:

| Property | Description | Allowed values | Required |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| recursive |Indicates whether the data is read recursively from the sub folders or only from the specified folder. |True, False (default) |No |

## Column mapping with translator rules
Column mapping can be used to specify how columns specified in the “structure” of source table map to columns specified in the “structure” of sink table. The **columnMapping** property is available in the **typeProperties** section of the Copy activity.

Column mapping supports the following scenarios:

1.	All columns in the source table “structure” are mapped to all columns in the sink table “structure”.
2.	A subset of the columns in the source table “structure” are mapped to all columns in the sink table “structure”.

The following are error conditions and will result in an exception:

1.	Either fewer columns or more columns in the “structure” of sink table than specified in the mapping.
2.	Duplicate mapping.
3.	SQL query result does not have a column name that is specified in the mapping.

## Column mapping samples
> [AZURE.NOTE] The samples below are for Azure SQL and Azure Blob but are applicable in the same way for any data store that supports rectangular tables. You will have to adjust dataset and linked service definitions in examples below to point to data in the relevant data source.

### Sample 1 – column mapping from Azure SQL to Azure blob
In this sample, the input table has a structure and it points to a SQL table in an Azure SQL database.

	{
	    "name": "AzureSQLInput",
	    "properties": {
	        "structure": 
	         [
	           { "name": "userid"},
	           { "name": "name"},
	           { "name": "group"}
	         ],
	        "type": "AzureSqlTable",
	        "linkedServiceName": "AzureSqlLinkedService",
	        "typeProperties": {
	            "tableName": "MyTable"
	        },
	        "availability": {
	            "frequency": "Hour",
	            "interval": 1
	        },
			"external": true,
			"policy": {
	            "externalData": {
	                "retryInterval": "00:01:00",
	                "retryTimeout": "00:10:00",
	                "maximumRetry": 3
	            }
			}
	    }
	}

In this sample, the output table has a structure and it points to a blob in an Azure blob storage.

	{
	    "name": "AzureBlobOutput",
	    "properties":
	    {
	         "structure": 
	          [
	                { "name": "myuserid"},
	                { "name": "myname" },
	                { "name": "mygroup"}
	          ],
	        "type": "AzureBlob",
	        "linkedServiceName": "StorageLinkedService",
	        "typeProperties": {
	            "folderPath": "mycontainer/myfolder",
	            "fileName":"myfile.csv",
	            "format":
	            {
	                "type": "TextFormat",
	                "columnDelimiter": ","
	            }
	        },
	        "availability":
	        {
	            "frequency": "Hour",
	            "interval": 1
	        }
	    }
	}

The JSON for the activity is shown below. The columns from source mapped to columns in sink (**columnMappings**) by using **Translator** property.

	{
	    "name": "CopyActivity",
	    "description": "description", 
	    "type": "Copy",
	    "inputs":  [ { "name": "AzureSQLInput"  } ],
	    "outputs":  [ { "name": "AzureBlobOutput" } ],
	    "typeProperties":    {
	        "source":
	        {
	            "type": "SqlSource"
	        },
	        "sink":
	        {
	            "type": "BlobSink"
	        },
	        "translator": 
	        {
	            "type": "TabularTranslator",
	            "ColumnMappings": "UserId: MyUserId, Group: MyGroup, Name: MyName"
	        }
	    },
	   "scheduler": {
	          "frequency": "Hour",
	          "interval": 1
	        }
	}

### Sample 2 – column mapping with SQL query from Azure SQL to Azure blob
In this sample, a SQL query is used to extract data from Azure SQL instead of simply specifying the table name and the column names in “structure” section. 

	{
	    "name": "CopyActivity",
	    "description": "description", 
	    "type": "CopyActivity",
	    "inputs":  [ { "name": " AzureSQLInput"  } ],
	    "outputs":  [ { "name": " AzureBlobOutput" } ],
	    "typeProperties":
	    {
	        "source":
	        {
	            "type": "SqlSource",
	            "SqlReaderQuery": "$$Text.Format('SELECT * FROM MyTable WHERE StartDateTime = \\'{0:yyyyMMdd-HH}\\'', WindowStart)"
	        },
	        "sink":
	        {
	            "type": "BlobSink"
	        },
	        "Translator": 
	        {
	            "type": "TabularTranslator",
	            "ColumnMappings": "UserId: MyUserId, Group: MyGroup,Name: MyName"
	        }
	    },
	    "scheduler": {
	          "frequency": "Hour",
	          "interval": 1
	        }
	}

In this case, the query results are first mapped to columns specified in “structure” of source. Next, the columns from source “structure” are mapped to columns in sink “structure” with rules specified in columnMappings.  Suppose the query returns 5 columns, two additional columns then those specified in the “structure” of source.

## Specifying structure definition for rectangular datasets
The structure section in the datasets JSON is an **optional** section for rectangular tables (with rows & columns) and contains a collection of columns for the table. You will use the structure section for either providing type information for type conversions or doing column mappings. The following sections describe these features in detail. 

Each column contains the following properties:

| Property | Description | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| name | Name of the column. | Yes |
| type | Data type of the column. See type conversions section below for more details regarding when should you specify type information | No |
| culture | .NET based culture to be used when type is specified and is .NET type Datetime or Datetimeoffset. Default is “en-us”.  | No |
| format | Format string to be used when type is specified and is .NET type Datetime or Datetimeoffset. | No |

The following sample shows the structure section JSON for a table that has three columns userid, name, and lastlogindate.

    "structure": 
    [
        { "name": "userid"},
        { "name": "name"},
        { "name": "lastlogindate"}
    ],

Please use the following guidelines for when to include “structure” information and what to include in the **structure** section.

1.	**For structured data sources** that store data schema and type information along with the data itself (sources like SQL Server, Oracle, Azure table etc.), you should specify the “structure” section only if you want do column mapping of specific source columns to specific columns in sink and their names are not the same (see details in column mapping section below). 

	As mentioned above, the type information is optional in “structure” section. For structured sources, type information is already available as part of dataset definition in the data store, so you should not include type information when you do include the “structure” section.
2. **For schema on read data sources (specifically Azure blob)**  you can chose to store data without storing any schema or type information with the data. For these types of data sources you should include “structure” in the following 2 cases:
	1. You want to do column mapping.
	2. When the dataset is a source in a Copy activity, you can provide type information in “structure” and data factory will use this type information for conversion to native types for the sink. See [Move data to and from Azure Blob](../articles/data-factory/data-factory-azure-blob-connector.md) article for more information.

### Supported .NET-based types 
Data factory supports the following CLS compliant .NET based type values for providing type information in “structure” for schema on read data sources like Azure blob.

- Int16
- Int32 
- Int64
- Single
- Double
- Decimal
- Byte[]
- Bool
- String 
- Guid
- Datetime
- Datetimeoffset
- Timespan 

For Datetime & Datetimeoffset you can also optionally specify “culture” & “format” string to facilitate parsing of your custom Datetime string. See sample for type conversion below.
