## Overview
This guide will demonstrate how to perform common scenarios using the Azure Blob storage service. The samples are written in C++ and use the [Azure Storage Client Library for C++](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-cpp/blob/v1.0.0/README.md). The scenarios covered include **uploading**, **listing**, **downloading**, and **deleting** blobs.  

> [!NOTE]
> This guide targets the Azure Storage Client Library for C++ version 1.0.0 and above. The recommended version is Storage Client Library 1.0.0, which is available via [NuGet](http://www.nuget.org/packages/wastorage) or [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-cpp).

## What is Blob Storage

Azure Blob storage is a service for storing large amounts of
unstructured data, such as text or binary data, that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via
HTTP or HTTPS. You can use Blob storage to expose data publicly to the world, or
to store application data privately.

Common uses of Blob storage include:

-   Serving images or documents directly to a browser
-   Storing files for distributed access
-   Streaming video and audio
-   Performing secure backup and disaster recovery
-   Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service

## Blob service concepts

The Blob service contains the following components:

![Blob1][Blob1]

-   **Storage Account:** All access to Azure Storage is done
    through a storage account. See [Azure Storage Scalability and Performance Targets](storage-scalability-targets.md) for details about storage account capacity.

-   **Container:** A container provides a grouping of a set of blobs.
    All blobs must be in a container. An account can contain an
    unlimited number of containers. A container can store an unlimited
    number of blobs.

-   **Blob:** A file of any type and size. Azure Storage offers three types of blobs: block blobs, page blobs, and append blobs.
    
	*Block blobs* are ideal for storing text or binary files, such as documents and media files. *Append blobs* are similar to block blobs in that they are made up of blocks, but they are optimized for append operations, so they are useful for logging scenarios. A single block blob or append blob can contain up to 50,000 blocks of up to 4 MB each, for a total size of slightly more than 195 GB (4 MB X 50,000).
    
	*Page blobs* can be up to 1 TB in size, and are more efficient for frequent read/write operations. Azure Virtual Machines use page blobs as OS and data disks.

	For more information about blobs, see [Understanding Block Blobs, Page Blobs, and Append Blobs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee691964.aspx).

## Naming and referencing containers and blobs

You can address a blob in your storage account using the following URL format:
   
    http://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<blob-name>  
      
For example, here is a URL that addresses one of the blobs in the diagram above:  

    http://sally.blob.core.windows.net/movies/MOV1.AVI

### Container naming rules

A container name must be a valid DNS name and conform to the following rules:

- A container name must be all lowercase.
- Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
- Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.
- Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.

### Blob naming rules

A blob name must conform to the following rules:

- A blob name can contain any combination of characters.
- A blob name must be at least one character long and cannot be more than 1,024 characters long.
- Blob names are case-sensitive.
- Reserved URL characters must be properly escaped.
- The number of path segments comprising the blob name cannot exceed 254. A path segment is the string between consecutive delimiter characters (*e.g.*, the forward slash '/') that corresponds to the name of a virtual directory.

The Blob service is based on a flat storage scheme. You can create a virtual hierarchy by specifying a character or string delimiter within the blob name to create a virtual hierarchy. For example, the following list shows some valid and unique blob names:

	/a
	/a.txt
	/a/b
	/a/b.txt

You can use the delimiter character to list blobs hierarchically.

## Create an Azure storage account

The easiest way to create your first Azure storage account is by using the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com). To learn more, see [Create a storage account](../articles/storage/storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account).

You can create an Azure storage account by using [Azure PowerShell](../articles/storage/storage-powershell-guide-full.md) or [Azure CLI](../articles/storage/storage-azure-cli.md), or by using the [Azure Storage Resource Provider REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163683.aspx).
 

## Create a C++ application
In this guide, you will use storage features which can be run within a C++ application.  

To do so, you will need to install the Azure Storage Client Library for C++ and create an Azure storage account in your Azure subscription.   

To install the Azure Storage Client Library for C++, you can use the following methods:

* **Linux:** Follow the instructions given in the [Azure Storage Client Library for C++ README](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-cpp/blob/master/README.md) page.  
* **Windows:** In Visual Studio, click **Tools > NuGet Package Manager > Package Manager Console**. Type the following command into the [NuGet Package Manager console](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/using-the-package-manager-console) and press **ENTER**.  

     Install-Package wastorage


## Configure your application to access Blob Storage
Add the following include statements to the top of the C++ file where you want to use the Azure storage APIs to access blobs:  

    #include "was/storage_account.h"
    #include "was/blob.h"

## Setup an Azure storage connection string
An Azure storage client uses a storage connection string to store endpoints and credentials for accessing data management services. When running in a client application, you must provide the storage connection string in the following format, using the name of your storage account and the storage access key for the storage account listed in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) for the *AccountName* and *AccountKey* values. For information on storage accounts and access keys, see [About Azure Storage Accounts](storage-create-storage-account.md). This example shows how you can declare a static field to hold the connection string:  

    // Define the connection-string with your values.
    const utility::string_t storage_connection_string(U("DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=your_storage_account;AccountKey=your_storage_account_key"));

To test your application in your local Windows computer, you can use the Microsoft Azure [storage emulator](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/hh403989.aspx)  that is installed with the [Azure SDK](https://azure.microsoft.com/downloads/). The storage emulator is a utility that simulates the Blob, Queue, and Table services available in Azure on your local development machine. The following example shows how you can declare a static field to hold the connection string to your local storage emulator:

    // Define the connection-string with Azure Storage Emulator.
    const utility::string_t storage_connection_string(U("UseDevelopmentStorage=true;"));  

To start the Azure storage emulator, Select the **Start** button or press the **Windows** key. Begin typing **Azure Storage Emulator**, and select **Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator** from the list of applications.  

The following samples assume that you have used one of these two methods to get the storage connection string.  

## Retrieve your connection string
You can use the **cloud_storage_account** class to represent your Storage Account information. To retrieve your storage account information from the storage connection string, you can use the **parse** method.  

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    azure::storage::cloud_storage_account storage_account = azure::storage::cloud_storage_account::parse(storage_connection_string);

Next, get a reference to a **cloud_blob_client** class as it allows you to retrieve objects that represent containers and blobs stored within the Blob Storage Service. The following code creates a **cloud_blob_client** object using the storage account object we retrieved above:  

    // Create the blob client.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_client blob_client = storage_account.create_cloud_blob_client();  

## How to: Create a container
Every blob in Azure storage must reside in a container. The container forms part of the blob name. For example, `mycontainer` is the name of the container in these sample blob URIs:

	https://storagesample.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/blob1.txt
	https://storagesample.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/photos/myphoto.jpg

A container name must be a valid DNS name, conforming to the following naming rules:

1. Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
1. Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.
1. All letters in a container name must be lowercase.
1. Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Note that the name of a container must always be lowercase. If you include an upper-case letter in a container name, or otherwise violate the container naming rules, you may receive a 400 error (Bad Request). 

This example shows how to create a container if it does not already exist:  

    try
    {
        // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
        azure::storage::cloud_storage_account storage_account = azure::storage::cloud_storage_account::parse(storage_connection_string);

        // Create the blob client.
        azure::storage::cloud_blob_client blob_client = storage_account.create_cloud_blob_client();

        // Retrieve a reference to a container.
        azure::storage::cloud_blob_container container = blob_client.get_container_reference(U("my-sample-container"));

        // Create the container if it doesn't already exist.
        container.create_if_not_exists();
    }
    catch (const std::exception& e)
    {
        std::wcout << U("Error: ") << e.what() << std::endl;
    }  

By default, the new container is private and you must specify your storage access key to download blobs from this container. If you want to make the files (blobs) within the container available to everyone, you can set the container to be public using the following code:  

    // Make the blob container publicly accessible.
    azure::storage::blob_container_permissions permissions;
    permissions.set_public_access(azure::storage::blob_container_public_access_type::blob);
    container.upload_permissions(permissions);  

Anyone on the Internet can see blobs in a public container, but you can modify or delete them only if you have the appropriate access key.  

## How to: Upload a blob into a container
Azure Blob Storage supports block blobs and page blobs. In the majority of cases, block blob is the recommended type to use.  

To upload a file to a block blob, get a container reference and use it to get a block blob reference. Once you have a blob reference, you can upload any stream of data to it by calling the **upload_from_stream** method. This operation will create the blob if it didn't previously exist, or overwrite it if it does exist. The following example shows how to upload a blob into a container and assumes that the container was already created.  

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    azure::storage::cloud_storage_account storage_account = azure::storage::cloud_storage_account::parse(storage_connection_string);

    // Create the blob client.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_client blob_client = storage_account.create_cloud_blob_client();

    // Retrieve a reference to a previously created container.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_container container = blob_client.get_container_reference(U("my-sample-container"));

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "my-blob-1".
    azure::storage::cloud_block_blob blockBlob = container.get_block_blob_reference(U("my-blob-1"));

    // Create or overwrite the "my-blob-1" blob with contents from a local file.
    concurrency::streams::istream input_stream = concurrency::streams::file_stream<uint8_t>::open_istream(U("DataFile.txt")).get();
    blockBlob.upload_from_stream(input_stream);
    input_stream.close().wait();

    // Create or overwrite the "my-blob-2" and "my-blob-3" blobs with contents from text.
    // Retrieve a reference to a blob named "my-blob-2".
    azure::storage::cloud_block_blob blob2 = container.get_block_blob_reference(U("my-blob-2"));
    blob2.upload_text(U("more text"));

    // Retrieve a reference to a blob named "my-blob-3".
    azure::storage::cloud_block_blob blob3 = container.get_block_blob_reference(U("my-directory/my-sub-directory/my-blob-3"));
    blob3.upload_text(U("other text"));  

Alternatively, you can use the **upload_from_file** method to upload a file to a block blob.

## How to: List the blobs in a container
To list the blobs in a container, first get a container reference. You can then use the container's **list_blobs** method to retrieve the blobs and/or directories within it. To access the rich set of properties and methods for a returned **list_blob_item**, you must call the **list_blob_item.as_blob** method to get a  **cloud_blob** object, or the **list_blob.as_directory** method to get a  cloud_blob_directory object. The following code demonstrates how to retrieve and output the URI of each item in the **my-sample-container** container:

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    azure::storage::cloud_storage_account storage_account = azure::storage::cloud_storage_account::parse(storage_connection_string);

    // Create the blob client.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_client blob_client = storage_account.create_cloud_blob_client();

    // Retrieve a reference to a previously created container.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_container container = blob_client.get_container_reference(U("my-sample-container"));

    // Output URI of each item.
    azure::storage::list_blob_item_iterator end_of_results;
    for (auto it = container.list_blobs(); it != end_of_results; ++it)
    {
        if (it->is_blob())
        {
            std::wcout << U("Blob: ") << it->as_blob().uri().primary_uri().to_string() << std::endl;
        }
        else
        {
            std::wcout << U("Directory: ") << it->as_directory().uri().primary_uri().to_string() << std::endl;
        }
    }

For more details on listing operations, see [List Azure Storage Resources in C++](storage-c-plus-plus-enumeration.md).

## How to: Download blobs
To download blobs, first retrieve a blob reference and then call the **download_to_stream** method. The following example uses the **download_to_stream** method to transfer the blob contents to a stream object that you can then persist to a local file.  

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    azure::storage::cloud_storage_account storage_account = azure::storage::cloud_storage_account::parse(storage_connection_string);

    // Create the blob client.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_client blob_client = storage_account.create_cloud_blob_client();

    // Retrieve a reference to a previously created container.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_container container = blob_client.get_container_reference(U("my-sample-container"));

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "my-blob-1".
    azure::storage::cloud_block_blob blockBlob = container.get_block_blob_reference(U("my-blob-1"));

    // Save blob contents to a file.
    concurrency::streams::container_buffer<std::vector<uint8_t>> buffer;
    concurrency::streams::ostream output_stream(buffer);
    blockBlob.download_to_stream(output_stream);

    std::ofstream outfile("DownloadBlobFile.txt", std::ofstream::binary);
    std::vector<unsigned char>& data = buffer.collection();

    outfile.write((char *)&data[0], buffer.size());
    outfile.close();  

Alternatively, you can use the **download_to_file** method to download the contents of a blob to a file.
In addition, you can also use the **download_text** method to download the contents of a blob as a text string.  

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    azure::storage::cloud_storage_account storage_account = azure::storage::cloud_storage_account::parse(storage_connection_string);

    // Create the blob client.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_client blob_client = storage_account.create_cloud_blob_client();

    // Retrieve a reference to a previously created container.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_container container = blob_client.get_container_reference(U("my-sample-container"));

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "my-blob-2".
    azure::storage::cloud_block_blob text_blob = container.get_block_blob_reference(U("my-blob-2"));

    // Download the contents of a blog as a text string.
    utility::string_t text = text_blob.download_text();

## How to: Delete blobs
To delete a blob, first get a blob reference and then call the **delete_blob** method on it.  

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    azure::storage::cloud_storage_account storage_account = azure::storage::cloud_storage_account::parse(storage_connection_string);

    // Create the blob client.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_client blob_client = storage_account.create_cloud_blob_client();

    // Retrieve a reference to a previously created container.
    azure::storage::cloud_blob_container container = blob_client.get_container_reference(U("my-sample-container"));

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "my-blob-1".
    azure::storage::cloud_block_blob blockBlob = container.get_block_blob_reference(U("my-blob-1"));

    // Delete the blob.
    blockBlob.delete_blob();
