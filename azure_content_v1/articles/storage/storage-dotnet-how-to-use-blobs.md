## Overview
Azure Blob storage is a service that stores file data in the cloud. Blob storage can store any type of text or binary data, such as a document, media file, or application installer. Blob storage is sometimes referred to as object storage.

This tutorial shows how to write .NET code for some common scenarios using Azure Blob storage. Scenarios covered include uploading, listing, downloading, and deleting blobs. This tutorial takes no more than an hour to complete.

>[AZURE.NOTE] We recommend that you use the latest version of the Azure Storage Client Library for .NET to complete this tutorial. The latest version of the library is 6.x, available for download on [Nuget](https://www.nuget.org/packages/WindowsAzure.Storage/). The source for the client library is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-storage-net). 

## What is Blob Storage

Azure Blob storage is a service for storing large amounts of
unstructured data, such as text or binary data, that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via
HTTP or HTTPS. You can use Blob storage to expose data publicly to the world, or
to store application data privately.

Common uses of Blob storage include:

-   Serving images or documents directly to a browser
-   Storing files for distributed access
-   Streaming video and audio
-   Performing secure backup and disaster recovery
-   Storing data for analysis by an on-premises or Azure-hosted service

## Blob service concepts

The Blob service contains the following components:

![Blob1][Blob1]

-   **Storage Account:** All access to Azure Storage is done
    through a storage account. See [Azure Storage Scalability and Performance Targets](storage-scalability-targets.md) for details about storage account capacity.

-   **Container:** A container provides a grouping of a set of blobs.
    All blobs must be in a container. An account can contain an
    unlimited number of containers. A container can store an unlimited
    number of blobs.

-   **Blob:** A file of any type and size. Azure Storage offers three types of blobs: block blobs, page blobs, and append blobs.
    
	*Block blobs* are ideal for storing text or binary files, such as documents and media files. *Append blobs* are similar to block blobs in that they are made up of blocks, but they are optimized for append operations, so they are useful for logging scenarios. A single block blob or append blob can contain up to 50,000 blocks of up to 4 MB each, for a total size of slightly more than 195 GB (4 MB X 50,000).
    
	*Page blobs* can be up to 1 TB in size, and are more efficient for frequent read/write operations. Azure Virtual Machines use page blobs as OS and data disks.

	For more information about blobs, see [Understanding Block Blobs, Page Blobs, and Append Blobs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee691964.aspx).

## Naming and referencing containers and blobs

You can address a blob in your storage account using the following URL format:
   
    http://<storage-account-name>.blob.core.windows.net/<container-name>/<blob-name>  
      
For example, here is a URL that addresses one of the blobs in the diagram above:  

    http://sally.blob.core.windows.net/movies/MOV1.AVI

### Container naming rules

A container name must be a valid DNS name and conform to the following rules:

- A container name must be all lowercase.
- Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
- Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.
- Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.

### Blob naming rules

A blob name must conform to the following rules:

- A blob name can contain any combination of characters.
- A blob name must be at least one character long and cannot be more than 1,024 characters long.
- Blob names are case-sensitive.
- Reserved URL characters must be properly escaped.
- The number of path segments comprising the blob name cannot exceed 254. A path segment is the string between consecutive delimiter characters (*e.g.*, the forward slash '/') that corresponds to the name of a virtual directory.

The Blob service is based on a flat storage scheme. You can create a virtual hierarchy by specifying a character or string delimiter within the blob name to create a virtual hierarchy. For example, the following list shows some valid and unique blob names:

	/a
	/a.txt
	/a/b
	/a/b.txt

You can use the delimiter character to list blobs hierarchically.

## Create an Azure storage account

The easiest way to create your first Azure storage account is by using the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com). To learn more, see [Create a storage account](../articles/storage/storage-create-storage-account.md#create-a-storage-account).

You can create an Azure storage account by using [Azure PowerShell](../articles/storage/storage-powershell-guide-full.md) or [Azure CLI](../articles/storage/storage-azure-cli.md), or by using the [Azure Storage Resource Provider REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163683.aspx).
 

## Setup a storage connection string

The Azure Storage Client Library for .NET supports using a storage connection string to configure endpoints and credentials for accessing storage services. We recommend that you maintain your storage connection string in a configuration file, rather than hard-coding it into your application. You have two options for saving your connection string:

- If your application runs in an Azure cloud service, save your connection string using the Azure service configuration system (`*.csdef` and `*.cscfg` files). See [How to create and deploy a cloud service](../articles/cloud-services/cloud-services-how-to-create-deploy.md) for details about Azure cloud service configuration.
- If your application runs on Azure virtual machines, or if you are building .NET applications that will run outside of Azure, save your connection string using the .NET configuration system (e.g. `web.config` or `app.config` file).

Later on in this guide, we will show how to retrieve your connection string from your code.

### Configuring your connection string from an Azure cloud service

Azure Cloud Services has a unique service configuration mechanism that enables you to dynamically change configuration settings from the Azure Management Portal without redeploying your application.

To configure your connection string in the Azure service configuration:

1.  Within the Solution Explorer of Visual Studio, in the **Roles**
    folder of your Azure Deployment Project, right-click your
    web role or worker role and click **Properties**.  
    ![Select the properties on a Cloud Service role in Visual Studio][connection-string1]

2.  Click the **Settings** tab and press the **Add Setting** button.  
    ![Add a Cloud Service setting in visual Studio][connection-string2]

    A new **Setting1** entry will then show up in the settings grid.

3.  In the **Type** drop-down of the new **Setting1** entry, choose
    **Connection String**.  
    ![Set connection string type][connection-string3]

4.  Click the **...** button at the right end of the **Setting1** entry.
    The **Storage Account Connection String** dialog will open.

5.  Choose whether you want to target the storage emulator (Microsoft
    Azure storage simulated on your local machine) or a storage
    account in the cloud. The code in this guide works with either
    option. 

	> [AZURE.NOTE] You can target the storage emulator to avoid incurring any costs associated with Azure Storage. However, if you do choose to target an Azure storage account in the cloud, costs for performing this tutorial will be negligible.

	If you are targeting a storage account in the cloud, then enter the primary access key for that storage account. To learn how to copy your primary access key via the Azure Management Portal, see [View, copy, and regenerate storage access keys](storage-create-storage-account.md#view-copy-and-regenerate-storage-access-keys).

	> [AZURE.NOTE] Your storage account key is similar to the root password for your storage account. Be sure to protect your key. Avoid distributing it to other users or saving it in a plain-text file that is accessible to others. Regenerate your key using the Management Portal if you believe it may have been compromised.
	
    ![Select target environment][connection-string4]

6.  Change the entry **Name** from **Setting1** to a friendlier name
    like **StorageConnectionString**. You will reference this
    connection string later in the code in this guide.  
    ![Change connection string name][connection-string5]
	
### Configuring your connection string using .NET configuration

If you are writing an application that is not an Azure cloud service, (see previous section), it is recommended you use the .NET configuration system (e.g. `web.config` or `app.config`). This includes Azure Websites or Azure Virtual Machines, as well as applications designed to run outside of Azure. You store the connection string using the `<appSettings>` element as follows. Replace `account-name` with the name of your storage account, and `account-key` with your account access key:

	<configuration>
  		<appSettings>
    		<add key="StorageConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=account-name;AccountKey=account-key" />
  		</appSettings>
	</configuration>

For example, the configuration setting in your config file may be similar to:

	<configuration>
    	<appSettings>
      		<add key="StorageConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=storagesample;AccountKey=nYV0gln9fT7bvY+rxu2iWAEyzPNITGkhM88J8HUoyofpK7C8fHcZc2kIZp6cKgYRUM74lHI84L50Iau1+9hPjB==" />
    	</appSettings>
	</configuration>

You are now ready to perform the how-to tasks in this guide.

## Programmatically access Blob storage
### Obtaining the assembly

You can use NuGet to obtain the `Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll` assembly. Right-click your project in **Solution Explorer** and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**.  Search online for "WindowsAzure.Storage" and click **Install** to install the Azure Storage package and dependencies.

`Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll` is also included in the Azure SDK for .NET, which can be downloaded from the <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/develop/net/#">.NET Developer Center</a>. The assembly is installed to the `%Program Files%\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\.NET SDK\<sdk-version>\ref\` directory.


### Namespace declarations
Add the following namespace declarations to the top of any C\# file
in which you wish to programmatically access Azure Storage:

    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure;
    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage;
    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Auth;
    using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.Blob;

Make sure you reference the `Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Storage.dll` assembly.

### Retrieving your connection string
You can use the **CloudStorageAccount** type to represent 
your Storage Account information. If you are using an 
Azure project template and/or have a reference to the
Microsoft.WindowsAzure.CloudConfigurationManager namespace, you 
can use the **CloudConfigurationManager** type
to retrieve your storage connection string and storage account
information from the Azure service configuration:

    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

If you are creating an application with no reference to Microsoft.WindowsAzure.CloudConfigurationManager, and your connection string is located in the `web.config` or `app.config` as show above, then you can use **ConfigurationManager** to retrieve the connection string.  You will need to add a reference to System.Configuration.dll to your project and add another namespace declaration for it:

	using System.Configuration;
	...
	CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
		ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["StorageConnectionString"].ConnectionString);


A **CloudBlobClient** type allows you to retrieve objects that represent
containers and blobs stored within the Blob Storage Service. The
following code creates a **CloudBlobClient** object using the storage
account object we retrieved above:

    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

## Create a container
Every blob in Azure storage must reside in a container. The container forms part of the blob name. For example, `mycontainer` is the name of the container in these sample blob URIs:

	https://storagesample.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/blob1.txt
	https://storagesample.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/photos/myphoto.jpg

A container name must be a valid DNS name, conforming to the following naming rules:

1. Container names must start with a letter or number, and can contain only letters, numbers, and the dash (-) character.
1. Every dash (-) character must be immediately preceded and followed by a letter or number; consecutive dashes are not permitted in container names.
1. All letters in a container name must be lowercase.
1. Container names must be from 3 through 63 characters long.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] Note that the name of a container must always be lowercase. If you include an upper-case letter in a container name, or otherwise violate the container naming rules, you may receive a 400 error (Bad Request). 

This example shows how to create a container if it does not already exist:

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve a reference to a container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

    // Create the container if it doesn't already exist.
    container.CreateIfNotExists();

By default, the new container is private and you must specify your
storage access key to download blobs from this
container. If you want to make the files within the container available
to everyone, you can set the container to be public using the following
code:

    container.SetPermissions(
        new BlobContainerPermissions { PublicAccess =
         BlobContainerPublicAccessType.Blob });

Anyone on the Internet can see blobs in a public container, but you can
modify or delete them only if you have the appropriate access key.

## Upload a blob into a container
Azure Blob Storage supports block blobs and page blobs.  In the majority of cases, block blob is the recommended type to use.

To upload a file to a block blob, get a container reference and use it to get
a block blob reference. Once you have a blob reference, you can upload any
stream of data to it by calling the **UploadFromStream** method. This operation will create the blob if it didn't previously exist,
or overwrite it if it does exist.

The following example shows how to upload a blob into a container and assumes that the container was already created.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "myblob".
    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("myblob");

    // Create or overwrite the "myblob" blob with contents from a local file.
    using (var fileStream = System.IO.File.OpenRead(@"path\myfile"))
    {
        blockBlob.UploadFromStream(fileStream);
    }

## List the blobs in a container
To list the blobs in a container, first get a container reference. You
can then use the container's **ListBlobs** method to retrieve the blobs and/or directories
within it. To access the rich set of properties and methods for a
returned **IListBlobItem**, you must cast it to a **CloudBlockBlob**,
**CloudPageBlob**, or **CloudBlobDirectory** object.  If the type is unknown, you can use a
type check to determine which to cast it to.  The following code
demonstrates how to retrieve and output the URI of each item in
the `photos` container:

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("photos");

    // Loop over items within the container and output the length and URI.
    foreach (IListBlobItem item in container.ListBlobs(null, false))
    {
        if (item.GetType() == typeof(CloudBlockBlob))
        {
            CloudBlockBlob blob = (CloudBlockBlob)item;

            Console.WriteLine("Block blob of length {0}: {1}", blob.Properties.Length, blob.Uri);

        }
        else if (item.GetType() == typeof(CloudPageBlob))
        {
            CloudPageBlob pageBlob = (CloudPageBlob)item;

            Console.WriteLine("Page blob of length {0}: {1}", pageBlob.Properties.Length, pageBlob.Uri);

        }
        else if (item.GetType() == typeof(CloudBlobDirectory))
        {
            CloudBlobDirectory directory = (CloudBlobDirectory)item;

            Console.WriteLine("Directory: {0}", directory.Uri);
        }
    }

As shown above, you can name blobs with path information in their names. This creates a virtual directory structure that you can organize and traverse as you would a traditional file system. Note that the directory structure is virtual only - the only resources available in Blob storage are containers and blobs. However, the storage client library offers a **CloudBlobDirectory** object to refer to a virtual directory and simplify the process of working with blobs that are organized in this way.

For example, consider the following set of block blobs in a container named `photos`:

    photo1.jpg
    2010/architecture/description.txt
    2010/architecture/photo3.jpg
    2010/architecture/photo4.jpg
    2011/architecture/photo5.jpg
    2011/architecture/photo6.jpg
    2011/architecture/description.txt
    2011/photo7.jpg

When you call **ListBlobs** on the 'photos' container (as in the above sample), a hierarchical listing is returned. It contains both **CloudBlobDirectory** and **CloudBlockBlob** objects, representing the directories and blobs in the container, respectively. The resulting output looks like:

    Directory: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/
    Directory: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/
    Block blob of length 505623: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/photo1.jpg


Optionally, you can set the **UseFlatBlobListing** parameter of of the **ListBlobs** method to
**true**. In this case, every blob in the container is returned as a **CloudBlockBlob** object. The call to **ListBlobs** to return a flat listing looks like this:

    // Loop over items within the container and output the length and URI.
    foreach (IListBlobItem item in container.ListBlobs(null, true))
    {
       ...
    }

and the results look like this:

    Block blob of length 4: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/architecture/description.txt
    Block blob of length 314618: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/architecture/photo3.jpg
    Block blob of length 522713: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2010/architecture/photo4.jpg
    Block blob of length 4: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/architecture/description.txt
    Block blob of length 419048: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/architecture/photo5.jpg
    Block blob of length 506388: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/architecture/photo6.jpg
    Block blob of length 399751: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/2011/photo7.jpg
    Block blob of length 505623: https://<accountname>.blob.core.windows.net/photos/photo1.jpg


## Download blobs
To download blobs, first retrieve a blob reference and then call the **DownloadToStream** method. The following
example uses the **DownloadToStream** method to transfer the blob
contents to a stream object that you can then persist to a local file.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "photo1.jpg".
    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("photo1.jpg");

    // Save blob contents to a file.
    using (var fileStream = System.IO.File.OpenWrite(@"path\myfile"))
    {
        blockBlob.DownloadToStream(fileStream);
    }

You can also use the **DownloadToStream** method to download the contents of a blob as a text string.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "myblob.txt"
    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob2 = container.GetBlockBlobReference("myblob.txt");

    string text;
    using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
    {
        blockBlob2.DownloadToStream(memoryStream);
        text = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString(memoryStream.ToArray());
    }

## Delete blobs
To delete a blob, first get a blob reference and then call the
**Delete** method on it.

    // Retrieve storage account from connection string.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    // Create the blob client.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    // Retrieve reference to a previously created container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("mycontainer");

    // Retrieve reference to a blob named "myblob.txt".
    CloudBlockBlob blockBlob = container.GetBlockBlobReference("myblob.txt");

    // Delete the blob.
    blockBlob.Delete();


## List blobs in pages asynchronously
If you are listing a large number of blobs, or you want to control the number of results you return in one listing operation, you can list blobs in pages of results. This example shows how to return results in pages asynchronously, so that execution is not blocked while waiting to return a large set of results.

This example shows a flat blob listing, but you can also perform a hierarchical listing, by setting the `useFlatBlobListing` parameter of the **ListBlobsSegmentedAsync** method to `false`.

Because the sample method calls an asynchronous method, it must be prefaced with the `async` keyword, and it must return a **Task** object. The await keyword specified for the **ListBlobsSegmentedAsync** method suspends execution of the sample method until the listing task completes.

    async public static Task ListBlobsSegmentedInFlatListing(CloudBlobContainer container)
    {
        //List blobs to the console window, with paging.
        Console.WriteLine("List blobs in pages:");

        int i = 0;
        BlobContinuationToken continuationToken = null;
        BlobResultSegment resultSegment = null;

        //Call ListBlobsSegmentedAsync and enumerate the result segment returned, while the continuation token is non-null.
        //When the continuation token is null, the last page has been returned and execution can exit the loop.
        do
        {
            //This overload allows control of the page size. You can return all remaining results by passing null for the maxResults parameter,
            //or by calling a different overload.
            resultSegment = await container.ListBlobsSegmentedAsync("", true, BlobListingDetails.All, 10, continuationToken, null, null);
            if (resultSegment.Results.Count<IListBlobItem>() > 0) { Console.WriteLine("Page {0}:", ++i); }
            foreach (var blobItem in resultSegment.Results)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("\t{0}", blobItem.StorageUri.PrimaryUri);
            }
            Console.WriteLine();

            //Get the continuation token.
            continuationToken = resultSegment.ContinuationToken;
        }
        while (continuationToken != null);
    }

## Writing to an append blob
An append blob is a new type of blob, introduced with version 5.x of the Azure storage client library for .NET. An append blob is optimized for append operations, such as logging. Like a block blob, an append blob is comprised of blocks, but when you add a new block to an append blob, it is always appended to the end of the blob. You cannot update or delete an existing block in an append blob. The block IDs for an append blob are not exposed as they are for a block blob.

Each block in an append blob can be a different size, up to a maximum of 4 MB, and an append blob can include a maximum of 50,000 blocks. The maximum size of an append blob is therefore slightly more than 195 GB (4 MB X 50,000 blocks).

The example below creates a new append blob and appends some data to it, simulating a simple logging operation.

    //Parse the connection string for the storage account.
    CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
        Microsoft.Azure.CloudConfigurationManager.GetSetting("StorageConnectionString"));

    //Create service client for credentialed access to the Blob service.
    CloudBlobClient blobClient = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();

    //Get a reference to a container.
    CloudBlobContainer container = blobClient.GetContainerReference("my-append-blobs");

    //Create the container if it does not already exist.
    container.CreateIfNotExists();

    //Get a reference to an append blob.
    CloudAppendBlob appendBlob = container.GetAppendBlobReference("append-blob.log");

    //Create the append blob. Note that if the blob already exists, the CreateOrReplace() method will overwrite it.
    //You can check whether the blob exists to avoid overwriting it by using CloudAppendBlob.Exists().
    appendBlob.CreateOrReplace();
