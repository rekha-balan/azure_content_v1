The Cortana Analytics Process uses a variety of data science environments for the storage, processing and analysis of data. They includes Azure Blob Storage, 
several types of Azure virtual machines, HDInsight (Hadoop) clusters, and Azure Machine Learning workspaces. The decision about which environment to use depends on the type and quantity of data to be modeled with machine learning, and the target destination for that data in the cloud. 

* For guidance on the questions to consider when making this decision, see [Plan Your Azure Machine Learning Data Science Environment](machine-learning-data-science-plan-your-environment.md).
